      <p>If my career doesn't go well and I don't enjoy the community of that department, I will go into the piano/music community. My father used to play the piano and my uncle plays the piano on my mother's side. So I think I get my piano skills from my father, but in my opinion I'm not that great and I need to do a lot of practice and learn more. However I believe that I have potenial in playing this and I hope I can become a pianoist if I can.</p>

       <p>Beethoven was a German composer and pianist. The first song I played on the piano that was maded by Beethoven is called, "Moonlight." I don't know why I chose this song, but for some reason it spoke to me when I pulled the piano in the basement. And I realize that it was apart of my childhood. And so I started to listen to some of his music and some jazz.

      <p>I haven't decided who will I go to if I do figure piano is my best bet. Sadly, I don't have a mentor to help me learn or teach me the basics of piano.  But, I believe that I will know in the future when the time is right. So, I hope it works out and I enjoy doing it with a clear mind.

      <p>Like I said before, don't have a teacher, but wish they have piano lesson in the school, then again teaching piano is a one on one type of class you have to teach. And its can be and will be diffcult to try to a teach piano with having so many people in the classroom. And you as a teacher have to go to each student one at time trying to show them and help do a miner and a major scale. Long story short, its going to take to time to do this, but I will be ready to be commited to the practice and the lessons.
